# Employee-Salary-Prediction
This project trains and compares multiple regression models (Linear, Decision Tree, Random Forest) to predict employee salaries using features like age, education, and experience.
Models are evaluated using RÂ² Score, Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE); the best-performing model is saved as best_model.pkl.
A Streamlit web app (hosted via Ngrok in Colab) allows real-time and batch salary predictions based on user input or uploaded CSV files.
